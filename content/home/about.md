# Biography

I am a PhD student in statistical learning at the Center of Applied Mathematics ([CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr)), Ecole Polytechnique.
My research interests include point processes, optimization, penalization techniques, proximal algorithms deep learning and multitask learning.

I am currently developing new methods to perform risk screening over large databases. My work is applied to the [SNIIRAM](https://www.ameli.fr/l-assurance-maladie/statistiques-et-publications/sniiram/finalites-du-sniiram.php), a large observational database containing electronic health records of most french citizen.

I work with Python, C++, Scala + Spark. Our team is developing [tick](https://x-datainitiative.github.io/tick/), a Python machine learning library on point processes. Check it out!

I like organizing hackathons for students, programming and snowboarding.
